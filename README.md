## Overview
NumHack is a three-day hybrid hackathon focused on open-source, AI, and scientific computing technologies, addressing environmental, economic, and socio-cultural challenges. Participants will have the opportunity to engage with mentors, attend workshops, and submit projects in one of three technical categories: **Build, Train, and Analyse**.

Organized by the PyData Impact Scholarship Program, a NumFOCUS initiative, and led by the NumHack committee of scholars and volunteers, the event is committed to promoting education and advancing AI for good. The main event will take place from November 22 to 24, 2024, with team formation starting the week of November 4, 2024.

NumHack will run concurrently with offline events hosted by partnering [PyData Chapters](https://pydata.org/numhack#chapters). If you're interested in getting your chapter involved, click [here](https://pydata.org/numhack/pydata-chapters).

Participants can expect valuable learning experiences, networking opportunities, cloud credits, AMA sessions with industry experts, and the chance to win prizes and showcase their projects to the PyData global community.

## Registration 📝
Registration will be open till November 17th. Visit the [Numhack homepage](https://pydata.org/numhack) to access the registration form.

You can participate individually or in teams of 2 to 5 members. Team formation will kick off two weeks before the event on Discord, with the official channel opening during the week of November 4. Join us there to introduce yourselves, form teams, discuss topics, and share ideas.

## Project Guidelines 📋

### Technical Categories
#### Build 🛠️
Build applications that utilize existing machine learning algorithms or AI models. Submissions in this category should focus on practical applications that implement AI in innovative ways. This includes creating user-friendly software, web applications, or platforms that can use pre-existing AI models to solve problems in sectors such as healthcare, sustainability, or education.

#### Train 🚂
Architect and train models, customize existing algorithms, or fine-tune on novel datasets. Submissions should demonstrate the development of machine learning models trained to tackle specific challenges. This includes using custom datasets, modifying existing algorithms to better address nuanced problems, or optimizing models for enhanced performance. Projects should document the training process, including data preparation, model architecture, and performance evaluation.

#### Analyse 🔍
Use AI tools to derive insights, create visualizations, and inform decision-making. This category focuses on submissions that utilize AI for data analysis and interpretation. Projects should aim to uncover hidden patterns or insights within datasets or models. Submissions could include predictive modeling, visualization dashboards, or reports demonstrating how data analysis can be leveraged to improve understanding and outcomes in various fields. Submissions could also include deep dives into components of AI systems with a research focus.
