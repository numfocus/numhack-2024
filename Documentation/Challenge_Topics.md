## NumHack 2024 - Challenges
Please find the NumHack 2024 Challenges below. The following challenges are designed to direct you towards more specific issues of AI for Good.
As a team, you can work on one of the challenges below or create your project outside of the following challenges (an open category).

### Mitigating Natural Disasters in a Changing Climate
Develop and/or experiment with AI tools to enhance the prediction, preparedness, and response to natural disasters exacerbated by climate change. Consider the challenges faced by impacted communities, and justify how your solution improves resilience, mitigates risks, or aids recovery efforts. Who benefits most, and how does your project align with environmental sustainability?

Example Directions:
- Develop a real-time early warning system that predicts natural disasters using diverse environmental datasets (Build)
- Predict the likelihood and impact of specific natural disasters using climate trend data (Train)
- Assess the long-term environmental impact of disasters (Analyze)

### Reducing Food Waste Through AI-Powered Innovation
Develop and/or experiment with AI systems to address food waste challenges. Think critically about supply chains, consumer habits, and redistribution networks. Define how your solution reduces waste, improves efficiency, and benefits key stakeholders in food production, distribution, or consumption.

Example Directions:
- Helps households track food expiration, suggests recipes, and reduces waste through personalized reminders (Build)
- Forecast supply chain inefficiencies and reduce overproduction in agriculture (Train)
- Identify patterns of waste and recommend redistribution strategies (Analyze)

### Enhancing Accessibility in Healthcare Through AI
Develop and/or experiment with AI tools to bridge gaps in healthcare accessibility, focusing on underserved populations. Address the challenges of affordability, geographic limitations, or disparities in healthcare quality. What is your target audience, and how will your solution improve equity and outcomes?

Example Directions:
- Provide initial medical advice to patients in rural or underserved regions  (Build)
- Identify early symptoms of common diseases using patient-reported data (Train)
- Uncover disparities in healthcare data for improving resource distribution (Analyze)

### Education.
Develop and/or experiment with AI solutions that enhance educational equity and accessibility. Focus on personalization, productivity, or skills gap analysis to make learning more effective and inclusive. Justify how your project empowers underrepresented communities and bridges educational divides.

Example Directions:
- Use AI agents and knowledge graphs to personalize lesson plans for students (Build)
- Identify and address skills gaps by analyzing educational performance data and creating adaptive tests (Train)
- Visualize trends in AI literacy and skill acquisition across demographics, proposing strategies to improve accessibility (Analyze)

### Customized Information Extraction.
Develop and/or experiment with AI tools to extract information from a domain of interest. Think carefully and justify how you define what is informative and the domain landscape. What problem does it solve? Who are the users? How is it good? Ex. Identify, highlight, and extract information, and/or filter and analyze information dense sources, de-emphasizing noninformation/noise. In the domain of world events, their respective news reports, media, comments, related social discussions, and responses, the sources of (and responses to) disinformation often use emotionally charged language to drive engagement.

Example Directions:
- Detect/filter non/disinformation through emotion use analysis (Build)
- Create a model to strip emotions to improve information density (Train)
- Convert news stories to RDF graphs and compare across media outlets (Analyze)
