## NumHack 2024 - Challenges
Please find the NumHack 2024 Challenges below. The following challenges are designed to direct you towards more specific issues of AI for Good.
As a team, you can work on one of the challenges below or create your project outside of the following challenges (an open category).

### Mitigating Natural Disasters in a Changing Climate
Challenge: Develop solutions that use AI to predict better, prepare for, or respond to natural disasters caused by climate change. This could include improving early warning systems, optimizing disaster response strategies, or creating tools to analyze and mitigate environmental impacts post-disaster.

### Reducing Food Waste Through AI-Powered Innovation
Challenge: Address the global issue of food waste by designing AI-driven solutions to optimize supply chains, enhance food recovery and redistribution efforts, or empower consumers to reduce waste through better planning, tracking, and education.

### Enhancing Accessibility in Healthcare Through AI
Challenge: Create AI-based solutions to improve access to healthcare for underserved populations. Focus areas could include remote diagnosis, diagnostic support, or systems that help identify and address healthcare disparities across different regions.

### Education.
Ensuring equitable access to AI-based solutions for marginalized and underrepresented communities. Personalization of lesson plans and skills gap specific testing. Productivity in learning, ex. using agentic methods/knowledge graphs

### Customized Information Extraction.
Develop and/or experiment with AI tools to extract information from a domain of interest. Think carefully and justify how you define what is informative and the domain landscape. What problem does it solve? Who are the users? How is it good?

Ex. Identify, highlight, and extract information, and/or filter and analyze information dense sources, de-emphasizing noninformation/noise. In the domain of world events, their respective news reports, media, comments, related social discussions, and responses, the sources of (and responses to) disinformation often use emotionally charged language to drive engagement.

Can we:
- Detect/filter non/disinformation through emotion use analysis? (Build)
- Create a model to strip emotions to improve information density? (Train)
- Convert news stories to RDF graphs and compare across media outlets? (Analyze)
